# Vanilla JavsScript Library App
This project was part of the Odin Project's JavaScript Track. The task was to produce an app which allowed a user to add books to their library. To accomplish this it was suggested that JavaScript object constructors were used. 

I initially followed this brief and compelted the app however my code was less than impessive, partly due to not having written in JavaScript for quite some time. I therefore re-wrote the applciation from scratch improving upon the initial brief by using industry preferred factory functions and the JavaSctipt Local Storage API, in the process also making my code more logical and readable.
