# Vanilla JavsScript Library App
This project was part of the Odin Project's JavaScript Track. The task was to produce an app which allowed a user to add books to their library, to accomplish this it was suggested that JavaScript object constructors were used. I initially followed this brief and compelted the app however my code was less than impessive, partly due to not having written in JavaScript for quite some time. I therefore re-wrote the applciation from scratch improving upon the initial brief by using factory functions and making my code more logical and readable.
